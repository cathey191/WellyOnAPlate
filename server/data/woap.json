Many have become iconic, much-loved and even collectible items in their own right. Eight years on, Garage Project\u2019s colourful and ever-changing beer labels are as well-known as its unique brews, making strong characters and memorable drinking experiences both on the outside of the package and the inside.\r\n\r\nBased on the book 'Garage Project: The Art of Beer', published by Penguin Random House New Zealand and launching in July 2019, this exhibition brings together a significant portion of that art for the first time.\r\n\r\nSee original sketches and finished artwork for the beers you love, including Pils\u2019n\u2019Thrills,  Aro Noir and BEER, along with insights into the creative process and talented people who made them, and the stories and inspiration behind the beers themselves.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition celebrates the long and fruitful collaboration between Garage Project and Visa Wellington on a Plate, and is a must-see for any food or beer fan.","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0}]},{"Venue":{"id":"699","region":"Wellington CBD\u2028","reference_num":"","aisle_number":null,"type":"","description":"1154 Pastaria serves fast, fresh & home-made pasta in the heart of Cuba street, alongside an organic & natural wine list.

Enjoy an evening of communal banquet seating, dine on a procession of continual plates of food from the kitchen and allow the music and atmosphere to carry you to another time and place.","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0},{"id":"1344","site_id":"5","facebook_tracking":"","external_link":null,"invoiced":true,"created":"2019-02-26 10:10:08","modified":"2019-05-15 11:40:50","views":"7","enabled":true,"cancelled":false,"hidden":false,"finalised":true,"featured":false,"close_tickets_x_minutes_before":"30","user_id":"1325","venue_id":"627","reference_num":"","title":"Psychological Gastronomy ","registration_fees":null,"event_type_id":"29","blurb":null,"content":null,"notes":null,"image":"https:\/\/goodcms.s3.amazonaws.com\/woap\/event\/woap-high-tea-190226-105953.jpg","image2":null,"json":null,"tags":null,"soldout":false,"sellingfast":false,"weeklong":false,"multiday":false,"label":"","label_flag":"","label_hex":"","region":null,"public_link":"\/event\/view\/1344-psychological-gastronomy","sessions":["2019-08-11 12:30pm 2:00pm 45.00","2019-08-11 2:30pm 4:00pm 45.00"],"session_tickets":[{"id":"1467","comp_tickets_required":"0","event_id":"1344","cost":"45.00","available":"50","sold":"0","date":"2019-08-11","start_time":"12:30pm","end_time":"2:00pm","open":true,"link":null,"alternate_text":"Adult\/Child","modified":"2019-05-15 11:40:50","printed":false},{"id":"1468","comp_tickets_required":"0","event_id":"1344","cost":"45.00","available":"50","sold":"0","date":"2019-08-11","start_time":"2:30pm","end_time":"4:00pm","open":true,"link":null,"alternate_text":"Adult\/Child","modified":"2019-05-15 11:40:50","printed":false}],"2019-08-11":"2:30pm 4:00pm 45.00","lowest_price":"45.00","highest_price":"45.00","dietary":"","category":"","short_description":"Eyes can be deceiving!

Born in Kenya to Indian parents Ravinder\u2019s food is inspired by her heritage, culture and her London upbringing. Her cookbook Cook in Boots was awarded Best Debut Cookbook at the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards. She\u2019s travelled the globe for Channel 4\u2019s TV show \u2018Food: What Goes in your Basket?\u2019, and also presented a special documentary \u2018The Great British Curry Trail\u2019 for the BBC. In 2016 she opened Jikoni restaurant to rapturous reception and critical acclaim. This collaboration celebrates the diversity of food enriched by each chef\u2019s culture and upbringing. Much as Laura Greenfield\u2019s passion for cooking stems from her Jewish family life in London, Ravinder draws on her mixed heritage of East African, Middle Eastern, Asian and British. They each create a five-course tasting menu complementing their similarities and differences. Taste both, exploring the diaspora of cuisine, of flavours and dishes shared across the regions.

Under the tutelage of Bruno Doucet who with Yves Camdeborde founded bistronomie, Ollie learned the principles of the movement: the rigour of haute-cuisine technique applied to simple, traditional dishes, using the best ingredients from the best producers. Ollie took his first head chef role in his mid-twenties and by the age of 30 he was owner-chef at Origins 14, the original R\u00e9galade, where he is one of the brightest lights of bistronomie cuisine.<br> <br> Glass owner Jonathan Brookes welcomes Ollie to Wellington. Combining their passion, knowledge and talent, together they create a multi-course degustation menu centred on the French culinary ethos of bistronomie. Paired with a complementary line up of natural wines, there\u2019s nothing prim and proper about this style of dining.

And it was that punk-rock attitude that drew her to working in kitchens and leaving our shores 33 years ago for London, where she\u2019s forged a hugely successful culinary career. Her much loved London eatery The Rochelle Canteen is now in its 15th year and has ascended to cult status, but she starts her days with a flat white and marmite on toast so clearly still a kiwi at heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoretta welcomes Margot Henderson for a lunchtime event that will bring together their shared values of food that is unfussy, simply delicious, a little messy, and entirely enjoyable.

He completed his apprenticeship in threestar hotel restaurant La Ferriere, and has been working his way around the world ever since. Laurent moved to New Zealand in 1995 and spent the first year in Pauanui at the Puka Park lodge. After a brief stint in Wellington, he spent the next few years working in fine-dining kitchens in Sydney and the southwest of France, but it was Wellington that stole his heart and drew him back. Since then he has head up the kitchens at Hummingbird, Hippopotamus and most recently Eat. Never one to be tied down, Laurant has now gone out on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmbra goes French for two nights only. Join acclaimed chef Laurent Loudeac and his chef pals (now of Ombra) as they serve up French bistro classics and rustic, countryside cooking. This multi-course menu will give you a true taste of France with Laurent drawing inspiration from his childhood. Fine food, definitely not fine dining.

Her dedication to mixing flour, water and a little magic to create the perfect loaf was the result of hundreds of hours of trials, refinements and many sleepless nights. Nancy\u2019s final product literally changed the bread game, as highlighted in a recent episode of the renowned Netflix series Chef's Table. Nancy is a chef, baker, and author and winner of the James Beard Foundation\u2019s Outstanding Chef Award in 2014. <br><br>Nancy\u2019s restaurant Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles is so well known many Angelenos can recite the menu by heart. And it\u2019s from the heart that much of Nancy\u2019s cooking comes from, so much so that it made Julia Child cry. Shepherd Elliott met Nancy while sitting at the Mozza Bar in LA last year and plucked up the courage to invite her to Wellington. We are thrilled that Nancy accepted and will be joining the team at Shepherd for a three-night collaboration.<br><br><b>Tickets for this event are limited, therefore to give everyone an equal opportunity to access tickets, these will be allocated and purchased via a ballot system.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.visawoap.com\/osteria-mozza-takeover-at-shepherd-ballot-form\"> Interested in going?
